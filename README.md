I’m a B.Tech Computer Science (AI & ML) student with a strong curiosity for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. I enjoy understanding how models work internally — from regression algorithms and evaluation metrics to convolutional neural networks and backpropagation.

I have worked on regression-based prediction models, implemented image processing techniques such as spatial filtering and edge detection using OpenCV, and explored CNN architectures for image classification. Along the way, I’ve gained hands-on experience with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data handling and experimentation.

I’m particularly interested in how training dynamics, hyperparameters, and optimization strategies affect model performance, and I’m continuously exploring these areas to deepen my understanding and improve my implementation skills.
